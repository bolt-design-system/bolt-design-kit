# Importing Text Styles
Currently, Abstract and Sketch shared libraries do not support text styles. Follow the steps below to install the correct text styles.

* Download and install the plugin http://www.textstyl.es/
* Download the Text Styles JSON file from GitHub or find it in the Design System folder on Box
* In the Sketch menu bar, go to Plugins > Shared Text Styles > Import Text Styles
* Select the JSON file


# Importing Color Palettes
There is a Sketch plugin that handles document and global colors, so I created a file for that. Here’s how to use it:

* Download the plugin and install it. See https://github.com/andrewfiorillo/sketch-palettes
* Download the file “Bolt_Global_Colors.sketchpalette” from GitHub or in the Design System Box folder
* Go to the menu bar in Sketch and select Plugins > Sketch Pallettes > Document or Global Colors > Load Palette (see note)

**Note:** You can pick whichever one you want based on your personal preferences.
